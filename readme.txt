CryptoBot is a automated trading bot desinged to automatically buy and sell ETH-USDT when the MACD 12 period signal crossed over the MACD 9 period signal line. There is also a backtrader program attached that can be used to test out the strategy against a csv built from data extracted from Yahoo Finance API. The backtrader program doesn't currently use the MACD as the indicators to test the strategy in the CryptoTrading bot. It uses the EMA (exponential moving average) of both the 12 and 26 timeperiods, and when the 12 crosses over the 26 it buys and sells when it drops below the 26.
